Tiny Math Library

A tiny math library to use in your side projects. The most important thing about it is usabilty and readability.

Assumptions

Tiny Math Library uses rows by column notation. It is templated, so you can use it with whatever type you wont, however it was designed to work mainly with float and double.

Problems to address:
 - is usage of templates really that good?
 - One Declaration Rule problems
 - there is only one way to mulitply (a.k.a A * B exist, but B * A doesn't)
 - do I really need to inline everything?
